SeqControl: A Python library for data-driven control of dynamical systems
===========================================================

**Date**: |today| **Version**: |version|

In the last decades, Machine Learning (ML) applications have had a great impact on molecular
and material science. However, every ML model requires a definition of its applicability domain. 
We developed a python package, X, that allows users to plot the chemical space of their
datasets. X contains smart algorithms behind which uses both structural and tailored
similarity. Moreover, it is easy to use even for non-experts.
For details on the background of SeqControl you can find more information here.

Check out the User Guide explanations of the methods used and the functionality.
