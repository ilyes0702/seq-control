#That line limits the computed D_ref values so they stay within the range 0.01 to 0.6.

# If any value in D_ref is less than 0.01, it becomes 0.01
# If any value is greater than 0.6, it becomes 0.6
# Values already between those bounds stay unchanged
# So it “clips” the dilution rate to a realistic range, preventing extreme values that might be infeasible in practice.
